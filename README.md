MACHINE LEARNING OPTIMISATION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES: A REAL CASE APPLICATION OVER TICKET ISSUING DATA

At the core of my Master Thesis relies the adoptinon of Artificial Intelligence with the goal of predicting the probability that a ticket issue, related to software
development tasks, will be solved within the assigned deadline given at the time of its creation. The secondary, or soft, objective was to improve information flow and investigate the dynamics underlying software development processes.

To do so, after a deep statistical analysis of the dataaet with related visualizations, I trained and cross-validated several machine-learning algorithms (eg. XGBoost, RandomForest, Logistic Regression, SVM) and finally select the best performing, which resulted in a recall score of 0.923 (92%).
